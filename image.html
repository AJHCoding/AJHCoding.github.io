            <div class="desc">The personal logo project was a project in which we were tasked in creating our own logo in Adobe Illustrator. 
            I made my logo to look like one of the aliens out of the game <i>Space Invaders</i>  by using connecting shapes. </div>

For my snail I went for a more metallic and robotic look and even put in little bolts in near the shell and on the floor.</div>

                <div class="desc"> The album project was a project where a group of students had to work together to create an album with a website, one track of music for each person in the group, and a piece of cover art for the album. I came up with both the name and the cover art for the album. True to its name, I used mainly neon colors as well as black and white. I stuck to using mostly cyan and red to simulate anaglyph 3D and I used it to wrap into the overall neon theme.    </div>

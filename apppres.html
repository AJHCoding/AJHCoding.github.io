            <p> This video was the project presentation that we presented to everyone in our Mobile App Development class. 
                Students were given an amount of fake money to invest however they saw fit into everyone's apps. 
                This short presentation was supposed to hook the audience by incorporating elements of analouge horror in order to increase audience engagement in the project. 
                I edited the entire video but the credits will show that I could not have completed the project by myself. 
                With this video and some improv after the presentation, we were able to get the most fake money out of all the groups! </p>

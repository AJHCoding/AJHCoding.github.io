            <h3> Menu & Laying Foundations </h3>
            <h4>Friday, April 19, 2024</h4>
            <p> This week has mostly been about laying the foundations of the gameplay in the game, as well as creating a main menu (pictured below). I have also implemented a new font
            for the game, which is currently being used for the main menu and the debugging text that appears for various systems. I have also laid the foundation for making the waves
            system in the game. Currently, my plan for how it will work is that a global variable named "enemcounter" will increment when an enemy is created, and decrement when an 
            enemy is destroyed. By using this system, the game can keep track of how many enemies are in play at any given time, and once the counter reaches zero, the next wave begins.
            How many enemies and whayt type of enemies that will spawn per wave will most likely be determined through math problems, and a limit of how many enemies that can be in play 
            will also be implemented (16, 24, or 32 [I haven't decided yet]). I've started to find a new resolve for completing this daunting task, and now that I have a plan I'm hoping 
            that things will progress more smoothly in the weeks to come.</p>
      
            <p> So far, my biggest obstacle has been implementing everything at a satisfactory speed. The deadline is fast approaching, and time is of the essence when I only have around 
            two weeks to complete as much as I can. I will admit that I drastically underestimated how much time it would take to hand code everything in this game, and that I most likely
            should have planned for this project to take MUCH longer than 4 months to complete, especially with my limited knowlege of the engine. However, I beleive that if I keep the 
            current pace that I'm at, I should (hopefully) be able to finish a playable alpha build of the game.</p>

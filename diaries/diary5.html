            <h3> Building Upon Everything (and Making Health Bars) </h3>
            <h4>Friday, March 1, 2024</h4>
            <p> Many miscellaneous changes were made to the game this week. I've added health bars, added more enemy varities, and performed bugfixes. 
                I'm currently building the foundation for several new things that are to be added. I'm planning on adding bosses, a wave based spawning system, a main menu, and functional UI. </p>

            <p> Going into the new month, I'm going to be spriting and developing audio and music for the game. 
                I will still be working on the main code of the game, but I'm going to be focusing more on developing assets to help contribute to the feel of the game, which currently has a very unfinished aesthetic right now. </p>
        
            <p> The biggest success for this week was being able to make healthbars for the game that work correctly. These healthbars will be very important for gameplay and bugfixing, and I believe that they will help the game take shape. 
                The largest challenges that have come from this week have been a persistant bug that I've been trying to fix for weeks now, and the destruction of my flash drive which had the most recent version of my game on it. 
                However, I'm hopeful that I'll be able to recover the data from the flash drive in one way or another. </p>

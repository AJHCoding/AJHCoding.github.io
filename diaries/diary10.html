            <h3> The End. </h3>
            <h4>Friday, May 3, 2024</h4>
            <p> It is now the 15th and final week of working on my project. I've been doing a lot of self reflection over these past few weeks, looking at what I've done, thinking about
            what I could have done, and wondering what there is left to do. My project is almost certainly not finished, and I've barely gotten it into a working state. I'm planning
            on working on this project outside of school (I think it would be fun) but for now, the project in its current form is what I've completed. I feel accomplished with what I've
            created, and I'm honestly quite happy that I made it this far. I may have set my expectations way too high when starting this project, but now that I know how long some parts
            of the process take I should be able to use that knowlege when planning out future projects.</p>
      
            <p> My biggest challenge for this week has mainly been time management, both in and out of class. My largest time suck has been my C++ class, and it has prevented me from working
            on the project that I actually care about. For some unknown reason, my C++ teacher thought it was a good idea to give us the task of making a text based adventure game in C++ for
            our final project. This has put me in the unfortunate predicament of developing two games at the same time, which has proven to be very time consuming and taxing on my mental 
            health. Hopefully everything will turn out ok for me next week, but I will need to work harder than I ever have in my entire life to finish my Java and C++ courses as well as 
            this class. as I'm writing this, I'm currently scheming up some ideas for my final project presentation, and I have put a couple of my rough sketches below.</p>

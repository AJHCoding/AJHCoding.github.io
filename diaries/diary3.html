            <h3>MORE ENEMIES</h3>
            <h4>Friday, Febuary 16, 2024</h4>
            <p> This week was a big success in terms of programming. I was able to create 3 new different varieties of enemies, each with their own unique behaviors. The first new variety of enemy is the most complex one. The enemy shoots rockets which seek the player once they enter its shooting radius, however, when the player gets too close to the enemy, it flees and does not shoot. My other two enemies are much more simple. One of the enemies seeks out the player within a large radius, and makes an attempt to ram them. The other enemy is supposed to be a foil for moving slowly in the game. When the player moves slowly the enemy moves faster, and when the player moves faster the enemy moves slower. This enemy should help to provide a counter to a player staying at a low speed. </p>

            <p> Challenges this week mostly consisted of planning out the logic and functions for the enemies, as planning some of it required thinking outside the box and creating solutions to problems I haven't solved yet. I'm planning on building more on gameplay next week, and developing some sort of objective or point that I need to protect. </p>

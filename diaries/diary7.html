            <h3> a New Camera & Weapons System </h3>
            <h4>Friday, April 11, 2024</h4>
            <p> This week has been very interesting in terms of making progress in the game. I've been working more on balancing and changing values for enemies, and i've just finished 
            adding health bars to all enemies that will appear so far (I missed a few previously). I've also been able to implement a new weapons system, where I use a number stored in the
            player object to determine which weapon the player uses. By doing this, I can easily implement new weapon types and test them on the fly by changing a number, which cuts down 
            time expended on testing significantly. However, my greatest accomplishment has been learning how to use the camera controls, and use them in my game. 
            Of course, I would not have been able to learn to use the camera controls as quickly as I did without the assistance of one of my classmates who is also building a game during
            this period. Using these camera controls has greatly expanded the possibillities for what I can do, but I need to remember to focus on building the basic features for the game.</p>
      
            <p> So far, my largest obstacle has been my lack of time outside of school to complete my game. Juggling 4 other classes on top of each other has proven to be an inescapable 
            vaccum for my free time, which proves a problem when I want to work on my game outside of school. I'm working as hard as I can to get the game in a playable state on time, but
            balancing everything in my life has been difficult. I'm hoping that next week, I'll be able to experiment with camera controls, and implement enemy search states.</p>

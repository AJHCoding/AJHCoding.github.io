            <h4>Friday, Febuary 8, 2024</h4>
            <p> The progress over this week was relatively steady, I've gotten the first A.I. in the game working, and any crashes that were caused as a result have also been dealt with. 
                Enemy destruction was also added, and the enemies can now be destroyed with the player's bullets (although, I may have to tweak some settings in the game's code to make the enemies easier to hit).
                I'll start diversifying enemy types and refining game mechanics next week, and maybe even learn how to make even more complex enemy A.I. (Fleeing, Searching, etc.). I was also able to study a bit on music
                theory this week and I'm planning on composing a few prototype songs either this week or the next.</p>

            <p> The largest obstacle this week has been getting everything to work without the game crashing in one way or another. Unfortunately, bugfixing takes time, and spending time 
                fixing bugs is time taken away from implementing features. I'm going to be implementing some new fixes for some persistant bugs on the day that this journal is being published to see if I can use them on other strange bugs I've been having.
                I'm hoping that in the future, I'll be able to fix bugs faster as I gain knowledge of the engine and how it works.</p>

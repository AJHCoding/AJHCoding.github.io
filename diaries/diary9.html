            <p> This week marks the 14th week of working on my game project, and also the nearing of the deadline for said project. I have made signinficant progress over this week,
            as I have almost implemented a gameplay loop into the game. My spawning system for the enemies works correctly, and waves will advance after all the enemies for that wave
            are destroyed. All I need to do now is to implement a system that spawns different varieties of enemies that is dependant on the wave, and a bit of random number generation.
            This is to add a bit of variety into gameplay, by introducing new types of enemies during different waves. I've been writing down my basic framework for how I want to code 
            the system in a google doc, and it has helped me immensely with visualizing how the systems in the game should be made. If I can get the spawning system done in a timely manner, 
            I can work on the upgrades system for the game, which will help the gameplay immensely. Hopefully the upgrades system isn't too hard to implement, as I already have the basic 
            framework done.</p>
      
            <p> The largest challenge for this week has been fixing the many bugs that are generated whenever I add something new to the game. These bugs have been incredibly persistant 
            and annoying, as they can take a lot of time to locate and fix. I'm hoping that no significant bugs will appear during development, however there is always a possibility for 
            one to appear. I've gotten better at spotting bugs within the game, however, bugs are still a major obstacle which I will have to learn how to stop in the future.</p>

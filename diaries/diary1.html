            <h3>Moving along at a steady pace</h3>
            <h4>Wednesday, January 31, 2024</h4>
            <p> Progress has been pretty good over the past few days, I imagine that I'll keep this pace into next week unless I run into a massive roadblock. I was able to implement the moving system I wanted for the game, and I was also able to implement shooting and enemy destruction. 
                I'm very exited about the movement system working, as that was one of the foundational things I needed to implement into the game in order to make it play like I want it to. I may have to reconfigure how the shooting system works later, as my work around for making the gun not shoot every frame may cause some lag.</p>

            <p> In terms of obstacles encountered, I have had many small obstacles that required some testing in order to fix any coding mistakes I may have made. The largest obstacle that I faced this week was getting the shooting to work in the way that I wanted it to, as many problems arose when 
                trying to implement that feature. I'm hoping that next week I can implement some simple enemies into the game, and maybe a single complex one if time provides. I'm also thinking of learning some more music theory over February, so I can make good music for the game when March arrives </p>

            <h3>Building the gameplay</h3>
            <h4>Friday, Febuary 22, 2024</h4>
            <p> This week has been all about building more of the fundamentals of the game. I've been building more on what the main objective and gameplay of the game are going to be and I've been working on building the central objective.
            Right now, my idea for the central objective is an object or base of some kind that the player has to protect. Enemies will arrive in waves, and will try and move towards the base to attack it. If the base's health reaches 0 then a game over occurs.
            I'm also considering a lives system, although that may make the game too difficult. If the lives system doesn't work, I may add a small punishment for player death like having to wait 2 seconds to respawn, which will make the central objective vulnerable to attack.
            I also may add in an upgrade system, where every 3 waves or so the player can return to the base pick an upgrade of their choosing. I have many concepts for upgrades, although I will have to wait quite a while to implement them.</p>

            <p>The largest success this week was being able to export my game files to my flash drive. By putting these files in my flash drive, I'll be able to work on my project at home as well, which I belive will increase my productivity twofold.
               In terms of challenges for this week, the main challenge has been implementing new features at a steady pace, as some features require making several new interactions between enemies and bullets.
               Next week, I'm planning on bulding further on fundamentals and enemies to flesh out the gameplay and to help the game take form. </p>

            <h3> Many happenings, and perhaps shifting the goalpost </h3>
            <h4>Friday, April 5, 2024</h4>
            <p> Many things have happened in the interim between this journal entry and the last one. So I will present my accomplishments for my game in a list:</p>
            <ul>
                <li> Implemented working health bars for both the player and enemies </li>
                <li> Implemented the first boss in the game, which has a much higher quality AI than most of the enemies in the game. </li>
                <li> Worked on balancing the firerate, speed, and other things to prevent the game from being too easy during the beginning. </li>
                <li> Created the plan for how the waves system should work, but more math needs to be done before it can work correctly. </li>
                <li> Fixed a bug with the healthbars draining downward instead of draining from left to right. </li>
                <li> Fixed a bug where the game would randomly crash if you die while an enemy is tracking you. </li>
            </ul>
            
            <p> My largest challenge that I have faced over this period of time has been completing my midterm presentaton, and not realizing how much time it would take to complete said presentation.
            My commitment to making things that somewhat resemble quality made me stop working on my game for an extended period of time, as I was busy working hard to complete my midterm.
            Not taking into account how much time and effort my midterm presentation would take has significantly delayed the implementation of features, music, sprites, and other things that the game needs in order to be content complete. 
            This delay is so significant, that I believe that I will not be able make the game in such a way to where all features that I want will be able to be made in time.
            This does not mean that I will stop trying to complete the game, as I will work as hard as I can to at least make the game playable before my deadline of April 29th arrives.
            </p>

            <p> My plan so far is to:((!!!) = neccecary) </p>
            <ol>
                <li> COMPLETE THE WAVES SYSTEM (!!!) </li>
                <li> Flesh out the enemy AI to make them attack the base and create an in between state for chase and idle (!!!) </li>
                <li> Make a main menu </li>
                <li> Implement Pausing </li>
                <li> Points? </li>
                <li> Fix any bugs that may arise from implementing these new features. </li>
            </ol>

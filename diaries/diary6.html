            <h3> Many happenings, and perhaps shifting the goalpost </h3>
            <h4>Friday, April 5, 2024</h4>
            <p> Many things have happened in the interim between this journal entry and the last one </p>

            <p> Not taking into account how much time and effort my midterm presentation would take has significantly delayed the implementation of 
            features, music, sprite, and other things that the game needs in order to be content complete. This delay is so significant, 
            that I believe that I will not be able make the game in such a way to where all features that I want will be able to be made in time.
            This does not mean that I will stop trying to complete the game, as I will work as hard as I can to at least make the game playable before my deadline of April 29th arrives.</p>
